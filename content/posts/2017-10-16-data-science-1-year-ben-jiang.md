**What did you study in school?**

mechanical eng and physics at Penn undergrad

**What made you want to do data science?**

applied to data science internship on suggestion of a friend, which was code heavy but seemed more interesting than software. enjoyed open-ended and cool problems: what's the problem, how can we solve the problem, more open techniques on how to solve the problem.

**What's your role / where do you work?**

I'm a data scientist at KeyMe. Our key value prop is in the tech and deep learning which we use to scan keys and model what the output should be.

**What did you expect to do as a data scientist?**

part strategy, looking for trends, correlations that others weren't finding, predictive modeling, a lot of communicating results to management and arguing for a path.

**What do you actually do?**

2nd hire on team, management transitions → etl / pipeline fires, lot of small asks, having a manager has been helpful again. more like independent research. built some optimization models, but not a lot of ML. trying to bring people up to speed with data / share data more broadly, e.g. marketing analytics people; teaching sql and aggregating data in a given way to help them, walking them through some data analysis questions and common pitfalls (e.g. causation vs correlation)

**What tools do you use?**

Python, TensorFlow and Keras, Pandas/Numpy, FB prophet, Redshift / SQL, Luigi for ETL, Tableau for visualization, Excel for everything which goes into PowerPoint

**Which teams or roles do you work the most with?**

Analytics is centralized - work with marketing (camapign performance), engineering (data integrity, ) ops (supply chain optimization, scheduling)

Information flows through analytics and it's hard to scale that to all teams - no single source, need to define ground truth metrics and statistics, making sure people make good decisions

**How did you have impact on the organization?**

Revamped store selection model from third-party to in-house model. Utilized new data sources and engineered new model which is 2x as good at predicting store usage. Inventory utilization: each machine can only have a certain number of slots for key molds, which ones will have the most usage, 50% better? Refund rates are down drastically because of improvements in error rate, by understanding the funnel. Dynamic pricing - increased core revenue by 25%

**How do you do experimentation?**

Set up user segmentation and assign users, run experiments in coordination with front end

**What's the most important thing you learned?**

It doesn't matter what you find unless you convince others to take action on your results.

**Any other advice you have?**

The difficulty of data science code is overhyped (concepts more difficult), ML isn't that important, it's not Kaggle where we're going from 95→99%. It's more about problem solving and ability to independently learn and research. most peoples' problems are not 100% unique, you can find research that's gets you 80% of the way there, your value is in knowing what to do and how to apply the existing research.
