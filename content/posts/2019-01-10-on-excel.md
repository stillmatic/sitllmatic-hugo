[I wrote about why banks use Excel and why their workbooks are insane.](https://www.quora.com/Why-did-investment-banks-choose-arguably-bad-technologies-such-as-excel-and-kdb-which-are-both-horrible-to-read-and-almost-impossible-to-maintain/answer/Chris-Hua-1)

Perhaps a bit more interestingly, I also wrote about why switching to R, despite Wharton's best efforts, isn't going to make bankers write clean, accesible code.
